# Fidelio
educational program for learning cryptography

Fidelio demonstrates several encryption schemes:

* Caesar ciphers including ROT13, ROT47, and the original 3-letter shift
* Polyalphabetic ciphers
* RSA public-key encryption using Euler's totient method for key generation

See the [fidelio demo notebook](https://github.com/samkennerly/Fidelio/blob/master/fidelio.ipynb) for an introduction.
The [RSA demo notebook](https://github.com/samkennerly/Fidelio/blob/master/RSA.ipynb) demonstrates RSA encryption.

In 2017, I completely rewrote Fidelio and replaced the old PDF documentation with Jupyter notebooks. The original 2009 code and docs are in the [ARCHIVE](https://github.com/samkennerly/Fidelio/tree/master/ARCHIVE) folder.

**Fidelio is designed for educational purposes and is not intended for secure communications.**
